# Keras / Tensorflow library for deep Q learning

This library can be used to train an agent using deep Q learning.
It follows the default CNN architecture used in the paper [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602).

Run python pacman.py to let an agent learn how to play the game MsPacman.

Run python pacman.py --test=True to visualize the learned agent playing a game after training.
